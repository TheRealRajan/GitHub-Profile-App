# GitHub-Profile-App
### An app where you can search for GitHub users with their username and see their account information.<br><br>
An app that allows you to search for a GitHub user using their <kbd>username</kbd>. <br><br>
If the username matches, you will see a card that displays the user's information along with their 10 most recent repositories.<br><br>
But if the username doesnt match or it doesnt exist you will get an error card saying that the user doesnt exist.<br><br>
If you click on the repository name, it will lead you to the actual repository. <br><br>
